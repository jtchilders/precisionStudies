# DDFUN v03 Port

Looking at porting [David Bailey's double-double math library](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/) from FORTRAN to C++.
I'm using ChatGPT-4O to do the heavy lifting.


* ddfun-v03: this folder is just a copy of his code
* cudaPort: this is my first attempt at porting the ddfun bits to run on a CUDA device.
